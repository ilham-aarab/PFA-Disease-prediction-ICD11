Disease ;Description
hypertensive;Although a continuous association exists between higher BP and increased cardiovascular disease risk, it is useful to categorize BP levels for clinical and public health decision making. Recent guidelines categorise systemic hypertension into 4 levels on the basis of average BP measured in a healthcare setting (office pressures): • Normal: systolic BP <120mmHg and diastolic BP <80mmHg • Elevated: systolic BP 120-129mmHg and diastolic BP <80mmHg • Stage 1 hypertension: systolic BP 130-139mmHg or Diastolic BP 80-89mmHg • Stage 2 hypertension: systolic BP 140mmHg or more, Diastolic BP 90mmHg or more In children, systemic hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child. The complications of uncontrolled or prolonged hypertension include damage to the blood vessels, heart, kidneys and brain.
Diabetes;Diabetes mellitus type 1 (type 1 diabetes, T1DM, formerly insulin dependent or juvenile diabetes) is a form of diabetes mellitus that results from destruction of insulin-producing beta cells, mostly by autoimmune mechanisms. The subsequent lack of insulin leads to increased blood and urine glucose.
depressive disorder;Single episode depressive disorder is characterised by the presence or history of one depressive episode when there is no history of prior depressive episodes. A depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. There have never been any prior manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder.
coronary  arteriosclerosis;Coronary dilatation which exceeds the diameter of normal adjacent segments or the diameter of the patient's largest coronary vessel by 1.5 times.
pneumonia;A disease of the lungs, frequently but not always caused by an infection with bacteria, virus, fungus, or parasite. This disease is characterised by fever, chills, cough with sputum production, chest pain and shortness of breath. Confirmation is by chest x-ray.
failure  heart congestive;A clinical syndrome characterised by abnormalities of ventricular function and neurohormonal regulation which are accompanied by effort intolerance and fluid retention.
accident  cerebrovascular;Fulfills criteria for stroke in that acute symptoms of focal brain injury that have lasted 24 hours or more (or led to death before 24 hours), but subtype of stroke (ischemic or haemorrhagic) has not been determined by neuroimaging or other techniques.
asthma;Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. It is characterised by an increased responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to various stimuli and manifested by a widespread narrowing of the airways that change in severity either spontaneously or as a result of therapy. This leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning.
myocardial  infarction;"The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI; Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL ) and with at least one of the following; a. Symptoms of ischaemia. b. New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). c. Development of pathologic Q waves in the ECG. d.

Doctors define a high number as at least 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of centrifuged urine. Pyuria can cause the urine to look cloudy or as if it contains pus.
anemia;A disease caused by determinants arising after birth, during the antenatal period or genetically inherited factors leading to premature haemolysis of red blood cells. This disease is characterised by low levels of red blood cells in the body due to abnormal breakdown of the cells. This disease may present with pallor, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Confirmation is by identification of low red blood cell count in a blood sample.
chronic  obstructive airway disease;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD), a common preventable and treatable disease, is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients.
dementia;Dementia is characterized by the presence of marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains relative to that expected given the individual’s age and general premorbid level of cognitive functioning, which represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning. Memory impairment is present in most forms of dementia, but cognitive impairment is not restricted to memory (i.e., there is impairment in other areas such as executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgment, psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). Neurobehavioural changes may also be present and, in some forms of dementia, may be the presenting symptom. Cognitive impairment is not attributable to normal aging and is severe enough to significantly interfere with independence in an individual’s performance of activities of daily living. The cognitive impairment is presumed to be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, or to use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined. The impairment is not due to current substance intoxication or withdrawal.
insufficiency  renal;Dementia is characterized by the presence of marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains relative to that expected given the individual’s age and general premorbid level of cognitive functioning, which represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning. Memory impairment is present in most forms of dementia, but cognitive impairment is not restricted to memory (i.e., there is impairment in other areas such as executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgment, psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). Neurobehavioural changes may also be present and, in some forms of dementia, may be the presenting symptom. Cognitive impairment is not attributable to normal aging and is severe enough to significantly interfere with independence in an individual’s performance of activities of daily living. The cognitive impairment is presumed to be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, or to use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined. The impairment is not due to current substance intoxication or withdrawal.
confusion;Acute state lasting more than one hour and usually less than a month. The comatose patient is unresponsive, lying with their eyes closed and cannot be aroused even by vigorous and noxious stimuli. Motor responses to noxious stimulation are limited to reflexive behaviour. Etiologies include but are not limited to traumatic, anoxic, infectious, neoplastic, vascular, inflammatory and metabolic brain injuries.

The symptoms occur with sufficient frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural norms. These symptoms do not arise as a feature of another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., a mood disorder, delirium, or a disorder due to substance use). The categories in this grouping should not be used to classify the expression of ideas, beliefs, or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned.
hyperlipidemia;"This is a genetic disorder characterised by high cholesterol levels, specifically very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, ""bad cholesterol""), in the blood and early cardiovascular disease."
bipolar  disorder;Bipolar and related disorders are episodic mood disorders defined by the occurrence of Manic, Mixed or Hypomanic episodes or symptoms. These episodes typically alternate over the course of these disorders with Depressive episodes or periods of depressive symptoms.
obesity;Obesity is a chronic complex disease defined by excessive adiposity that can impair health. It is in most cases a multifactorial disease due to obesogenic environments, psycho-social factors and genetic variants. In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified (medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, monogenic disease/genetic syndrome). Body mass index (BMI) is a surrogate marker of adiposity calculated as weight (kg)/height² (m²). The BMI categories for defining obesity vary by age and gender in infants, children and adolescents. For adults, obesity is defined by a BMI greater than or equal to 30.00 kg/m². There are three levels of severity in recognition of different management options.

Representative examples of adenocarcinoma are ductal and lobular breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma), colon adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma.
paranoia;Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from alcohol. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Alcohol intoxication or Alcohol withdrawal. The amount and duration of alcohol use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the alcohol use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the alcohol use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with alcohol use).

malignant  neoplasm of prostate;Prostate cancer contributes significantly to the overall cancer burden, being the most frequent malignant neoplasia in men. The number of cases has continuously increased over the past decades, partly due to the higher life expectancy. An additional factor is the Western lifestyle, characterised by a highly caloric diet and lack of physical exercise. Epidemiological data indicates that black people are most susceptible, followed by white people, while Asian people have the lowest risk. The extent to which prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by PSA screening, is currently being evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis and grading play a major role in the management of prostate cancer

edema  pulmonary;Pulmonary oedema is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
lymphatic  diseases;Infestation by filarial nematodes of the genera Wuchereria and Brugii. It is acquired via transcutaneous injection of larvae by mosquitoes previously infested with microfilariae from the blood of a human host. The adult worms live in the lymphatics but release microfilariae into the bloodstream to complete the life cycle of the parasite. Clinical disease occurs in only a minority of those infected. In the acute stage this may present as an acute painful adenolymphangitis with fever. Chronic infestation causes progressive obstruction of lymphatic vessels and can result in disfiguring lymphoedema (elephantiasis), particularly of the genitalia and lower extremities.

These changes include diffuse erythema, edema, peau d'orange (skin of an orange) appearance, tenderness, induration, warmth, enlargement, and in some cases a palpable mass. The skin changes are the consequence of lymphatic obstruction from the underlying invasive breast adenocarcinoma. Microscopically, the dermal lymphatics show prominent infiltration by malignant cells. The invasive breast adenocarcinoma is usually of ductal, NOS type. There is not significant inflammatory cell infiltrate present, despite the name of this carcinoma.
schizophrenia;Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders are characterised by significant impairments in reality testing and alterations in behaviour manifest in positive symptoms such as persistent delusions, persistent hallucinations, disorganised thinking (typically manifest as disorganised speech), grossly disorganised behaviour, and experiences of passivity and control, negative symptoms such as blunted or flat affect and avolition, and psychomotor disturbances. The symptoms occur with sufficient frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural norms. These symptoms do not arise as a feature of another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., a mood disorder, delirium, or a disorder due to substance use). The categories in this grouping should not be used to classify the expression of ideas, beliefs, or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned.
diverticulitis;Diverticulum of oesophagus is a disorder having out-pouchings from the oesophageal wall.
overload  fluid;This is the condition where there is too much fluid in the blood. The opposite condition is hypovolemia, which is too little fluid volume in the blood. Fluid volume excess in the intravascular compartment occurs due to an increase in total body sodium content and a consequent increase in extracellular body water. The mechanism usually stems from compromised regulatory mechanisms for sodium handling as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF), kidney failure, and liver failure. It may also be caused by excessive intake of sodium from foods, intravenous (IV) solutions and blood transfusions, medications, or diagnostic contrast dyes.
ulcer  peptic;Peptic ulcer is defined as a distinct breach in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract as a result of caustic effects of acid and pepsin in the lumen.

gout;Gout is an acute or chronic arthropathy resulting from deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in joint tissues. It is strongly associated with hyperuricaemia, which may be secondary to certain drugs, poisons or lymphoproliferative disorders. Gout is definitively diagnosed by demonstration of urate crystals in aspirated synovial fluid in the absence of an alternative aetiology for arthritis. It may be associated with focal urate deposition in skin and subcutaneous tissue (tophaceous gout) and with urate nephropathy

Transmission is by blood and body fluid contamination, sexual transmission, and from mother to baby at the time of birth (vertical transmission). Confirmation of the diagnosis is by detection of HBsAg, but assessment of severity, prognosis and indication for treatment requires quantification of HBV DNA in serum.
parkinson  disease;Parkinson Disease is a gradual onset progressive degenerative disease whose cardinal manifestations include bradykinesia plus one of the following-tremor, rigidity or postural instability. Nonmotor manifestations include autonomic dysfunction and neuropsychiatric features.
lymphoma;"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a neoplasm composed of follicle centre (germinal centre) B-cells (typically both centrocytes and centroblasts/large transformed cells), which usually has at least a partially follicular pattern. t(14;18) with BCL2 rearrangement is frequently observed. If diffuse areas of any size comprised predominantly or entirely of blastic cells are present in any case of follicular lymphoma, a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is also made.

emphysema  pulmonary;"Emphysema is defined by abnormal and permanent enlargement of the airspaces that are distal to the terminal bronchioles. This is accompanied by destruction of the airspace walls, without obvious fibrosis (i.e. there is no fibrosis visible to the naked eye). Emphysema can exist in individuals who do not have airflow obstruction; however, it is more common among patients who have moderate or severe airflow obstruction."
hemorrhoids;Haemorrhoids are anatomical structures of swollen veins of the rectal plexus in the walls of the anal canal and /or under the skin around the anus. The term haemorrhoids is usually related to the symptoms caused by haemorrhoids resulting in bleeding and painful swelling when they become enlarged, inflamed, thrombosed, or prolapsed. Haemorrhoids are classified according to the degree of prolapse, although this may not always reflect the severity of symptoms.

Basic mechanism is the degeneration of neurons (ganglion cells) in the myenteric plexuses in the oesophageal wall, but the cause is still unclear.
aphasia;rontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of primary neurodegenerative disorders primarily affecting the frontal and temporal lobes. Onset is typically insidious with a gradual and worsening course. Several syndromic variants (some with an identified genetic basis or familiality) are described that include presentations with predominantly marked personality and behavioral changes (such as executive dysfunction, apathy, deterioration of social cognition, repetitive behaviours, and dietary changes),predominantly language deficits (that include semantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic forms), predominantly movement-related deficits (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple systems atrophy, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), or a combination of these deficits. Memory function, often remains relatively intact, particularly during the early stages of the disorder.
obesity  morbid;Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30.00 kg/m². There are three levels of severity in recognition of different management options.
pyelonephritis;Tuberculosis involving the urinary tract and/or reproductive organs. The primary site of infection is most commonly the kidney as a result of haematogenous spread from distant sites: infection may then spread further down the urinary tract and/or to the reproductive organs. Genital infection may be sexually transmitted.
endocarditis;This is a late, sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. This diagnosis is involving the cardiovascular area.
effusion  pericardial;Pericardial effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Noninflammatory diseases such as chronic renal failure, circulatory congestion, hypothyroidism and amyroidosis can cause pericardial effusion.
chronic  alcoholic intoxication;Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from alcohol. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Alcohol intoxication or Alcohol withdrawal. The amount and duration of alcohol use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the alcohol use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the alcohol use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with alcohol use).
pneumothorax;Pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air or gas in the pleural space that separates the lung from the chest wall, and that may interfere with normal breathing.
delirium;Delirium is characterized by a disturbance of attention, orientation, and awareness that develops within a short period of time, typically presenting as significant confusion or global neurocognitive impairment, with transient symptoms that may fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, and may include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. A disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, including reduced arousal of acute onset or total sleep loss with reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, may also be present. Delirium may be caused by the direct physiological effects of a medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders, by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication, including withdrawal, or by multiple or unknown etiological factors.
neutropenia;This is a granulocyte disorder characterised by an abnormally low number of neutrophils. Neutrophils usually make up 50-70% of circulating white blood cells and serve as the primary defence against infections by destroying bacteria in the blood.
hyperbilirubinemia;A disease caused by determinants such as infection, toxic chemicals, drugs and trauma arising after birth. This disease is characterised by haemolysis of red blood cells. This disease may present with pallor, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Confirmation is by identification of decreased red blood cell count in a blood sample and negative Coombs test result.
influenza;Any disease of the respiratory system, caused by an infection with influenza virus. These diseases are characterised by fever, cough, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, or malaise. Transmission is by inhalation of infected respiratory secretions. Confirmation is by identification of influenza virus from a nasopharyngeal, nose, or throat swab.
dependence;Alcohol dependence is a disorder of regulation of alcohol use arising from repeated or continuous use of alcohol. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use alcohol, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use alcohol. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of alcohol, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of alcohol, or repeated use of alcohol or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if alcohol use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
thrombus;Obstruction associated with prosthetic devices, grafts or implants
cholecystitis;"Inflammation of gallbladder wall by infection of various organism and/or unspecified disorders.
"
hernia  hiatal;A hernia occurs through the foramen in the diaphragm.
migraine  disorders;A primary headache disorder, in most cases episodic. Disabling attacks lasting 4-72 hours are characterised by moderate or severe headache, usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting and/or photophobia and phonophobia, and sometimes preceded by a short-lasting aura of unilateral fully-reversible visual, sensory or other central nervous system symptoms. In a small minority of cases headache, but not necessarily the associated symptoms, becomes very frequent, with loss of episodicity.
pancytopenia;A disease caused by determinants in the antenatal period leading to the inability of stem cells to generate new mature cells. This disease is characterised by low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets. This disease may present with pallor, fatigue, dizziness, increased risk of infection or increased bruising or bleeding.
cholelithiasis;Cholelithiasis is calculus of gallbladder, cystic duct or bile duct. Most stones in the gallbladder are asymptomatic, but the most common initial symptom is biliary colic before the development of complications, including acute cholecystitis or cholangitis.
tachycardia  sinus;Abnormalities of heart beat is arrhythmia which is any disorder of the heart rate or rhythm. It means that the heart beats too quickly, too slowly or with an irregular pattern.
ileus;A type of ileus, a functional not mechanical obstruction of the small intestines, and a state of pathophysiologic inhibition of motor activity due to non-mechanical causes. The paralysis does not need to be complete, but the intestinal muscles must be so inactive that it leads to a functional blockage of the intestine.
adhesion;Any condition of the nervous system, caused by an infection with a bacterial, fungal, parasitic or unspecified source.
delusion;A belief that is demonstrably untrue or not shared by others, usually based on incorrect inference about external reality. The belief is firmly held with conviction and is not, or is only briefly, susceptible to modification by experience or evidence that contradicts it. The belief is not ordinarily accepted by other members or the person's culture or subculture (i.e., it is not an article of religious faith).
affect  labile;Marked variability in emotional expression, with repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts.
decubitus  ulcer;A condition of the cervix uteri, caused by an increase in the total estrogen level in the body. This condition is characterised by protrusion and transformation of the endocervical columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium on the cervix uteri. This condition may also present with non-purulent vaginal discharge, post-coital bleeding, or may be asymptomatic.
